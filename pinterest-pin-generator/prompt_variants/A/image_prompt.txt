Create a Pinterest pin using this photo for the {pattern_name} pdf sewing pattern by Sinclair Patterns.
Bright and airy style.

LAYOUT:
- Model should fill approximately 75-80% of vertical space
- Position model very slightly off-center to leave space for text
- Do not crop head. If the source has cropped / in the grass feet/shoes, crop higher (ankles, below knees, or hip) depending on where garment finishes
- Use best fashion photography practices for cropping
- Pinterest vertical format

BACKGROUND:
- Remove the original background with clean, professional edges
- No visible dark fringe, halo, or outline around the cutout
- Replace with soft gradient using at least 2 complementary colors that will create an expensive feel and elegant combination (not cheap colors or cheap look lines or cheap color combinations)
- The garment should pop against the background
- Add very subtle gradient lines or linear shapes for airiness and modern feel
- Background must complement the garment: 30-40% lighter or darker than garment
- Avoid muddy combinations (brown on brown, beige on beige, warm on warm)
- Use complementary color theory to make garment stand out

LIGHTING & MODEL INTEGRATION:
- CRITICAL: Model must look like she is standing IN this BACKGROUND
- BUTTERFLY lightning on the face
- Increase model's overall exposure to match background brightness. Model exposure should match or slightly exceed background brightness
- Color temperature of model's skin must match the background warmth/coolness
- If background is cool and bright, model should have cool bright lighting
- If model looks darker or warmer than the background, adjust until they match

PHOTO ENHANCEMENT:
- Light retouch: softer skin tone, smooth skin and garment lines
- Brighten eye whites and teeth subtly (if visible)
- Light sheen on hair
- If a model too pale, add a subtle blush
- Strong studio beauty light, slightly bright and airy, skin glow, HDR
- Overall bright, high-key look with lifted whites
- Do NOT change physical appearance of model (no reshaping)
- Lens and angle correction only
- Adjust skin tone slightly to harmonize with garment and background color temperature

SHADOW/DEPTH:
- DO NOT add dark edge shadow or outline tracing the model's silhouette
- NO tight drop shadow around the body
- Shadow opacity maximum 15-20%, at least 50px
- Think "soft natural light" not "spotlight against wall or ground"

TYPOGRAPHY:

Text placement:
- Position text block in top 25% but never over the garment
- Align left or center (be consistent)
- Never place text over the model or garment
- Ensure strong contrast between text and background (dark text on light bg, or light text on dark bg)

Hierarchy and sizing (relative to pin height) - all aligned:
- Pattern name {pattern_name} : 10-12% of pin height, ALL CAPS, bold or semi-bold weight
- "pdf sewing pattern": 5-6% of pin height, sentence case, bold weight, positioned directly below pattern name
- "by Sinclair Patterns": 4% of pin height, regular weight, subtle but legible

Font:
- Use ONE clean sans-serif font family throughout (similar to Montserrat, DM Sans, Poppins, or Helvetica)
- NO serif fonts
- NO script or decorative fonts
- Consistent letter spacing

Text color:
- Use charcoal (#333333) or dark gray on light backgrounds
- Use off-white (#F5F5F5) on dark backgrounds
- Never pure black or pure white
